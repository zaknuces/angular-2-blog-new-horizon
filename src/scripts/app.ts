/**
 * The main entry point to our angular application. Important things to note:
 * 1: Angular 2 is based on the idea of Components. Components are the new versions of Directives.
 * 2: Component has three parts:
 *      1: A Component Annotation (Annotation is a way of adding metadata to the code).
 *      2: A View Annotation
 *      3: A definition class
 *
 * Created by owais zahid <owais.zahid@autodesk.com> on 10/30/2015.
 *
 * This application is mainly based on
 * - angular 5 mins quick start <@link https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html>
 *
 * Other references and inspirations:
 * Angular Documentation and Code.
